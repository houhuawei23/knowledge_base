## Introduction

A single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cannot easily complete tasks with increasing complexity; hence, the cooperation of UAV swarms is important[1]. In this context, UAV swarm task planning has emerged at a historic moment. UAV swarm task allocation is a vital improve autonomy. As shown in Fig. 1, the task allocation of UAV swarms involves assigning optimal plans to each UAV[2] by referring to the tasks that UAV swarms can complete while satisfying relevant constraint requirements; the goal is to realize the maximum benefits with a minimum cost. According to the certainty of the assignment environment, the task assignment of UAV swarms to ground targets can be divided into two types: static and dynamic task assignments. In static task allocation, the swarm state is determined, and the location of the target is known and fixed; thus, the allocation is relatively simple. In dynamic task allocation, the swarm state, target location, and environment are constantly changing. Therefore, dynamic task allocation is more difficult to implement than static task allocation. This difference can be explained as follows: First, the environment changes rapidly, and the tasks are complex and diverse. These factors greatly increase the difficulty of the model establishment. Second, dynamic task allocation involves a large number of constraint indicators, such as task balance, damage cost, flight distance, consumption cost, and target income. It is an NP-hard problem and requires timeliness for the algorithm. Third, cluster dynamic task allocation requires good real-time communication within the cluster, but the communication capability of UAVs is very limited[3]. Finally, UAV swarms are heterogeneous UAVs with different uses, loads, and mission capabilities and are thus difficult to coordinate. Nevertheless, as one of the key issues in the collaborative operation of UAV swarms, dynamic task assignment[4] is a hot, important, and difficult problem in the field of task planning[5], and it has been widely studied by many scholars in recent years.

单个无人机（UAV）难以轻松完成日益复杂的任务；因此，无人机群的协作显得尤为重要 [1] 。在此背景下，无人机群任务规划应运而生。无人机群任务分配是提升自主性的关键环节。如 Fig. 1 所示，无人机群的任务分配涉及为每架无人机 [2] 制定最优计划，参考无人机群能够完成的任务，同时满足相关约束条件；目标是以最小成本实现最大效益。根据分配环境的确定性，无人机群对地面目标的任务分配可分为静态和动态任务分配两种类型。在静态任务分配中，群体状态确定，目标位置已知且固定；因此，分配相对简单。在动态任务分配中，群体状态、目标位置及环境不断变化。因此，动态任务分配比静态任务分配更难实施。 这种差异可以解释如下：首先，环境变化迅速，任务复杂多样。这些因素大大增加了模型建立的难度。其次，动态任务分配涉及大量约束指标，如任务平衡、损坏成本、飞行距离、消耗成本和目标收益。这是一个 NP 难问题，算法需要具备时效性。第三，集群动态任务分配要求集群内部具有良好的实时通信能力，但无人机的通信能力非常有限 [3] 。最后，无人机群是用途、载荷和任务能力各不相同的异构无人机，因此协调起来十分困难。尽管如此，作为无人机群协同操作的关键问题之一，动态任务分配 [4] 是任务规划领域中的一个热点、重要且困难的问题 [5] ，近年来已被众多学者广泛研究。

The main purpose of the dynamic allocation of UAV swarms for ground targets is to reasonably allocate effective task sequences to UAVs according to the current situation of the ground battlefield under various constraints, such as task type, time sequence, and UAV combat capability and payload, so as to achieve the optimal or suboptimal overall combat effectiveness. Therefore, the dynamic task allocation problem of UAV swarms oriented to ground targets is a combinatorial optimization NP problem under multiple constraints[6]. The key to solving the problem is to establish and solve the dynamic task allocation model.

无人机群对地面目标的动态分配主要目的是根据地面战场当前情况，在任务类型、时间顺序、无人机作战能力和有效载荷等多种约束条件下，合理地为无人机分配有效任务序列，以实现整体作战效果的最优或次优。因此，面向地面目标的无人机群动态任务分配问题是一个**多约束条件下的组合优化 NP 问题** [6] 。解决该问题的关键在于建立并求解动态任务分配模型。

### 2.3 Establishment of the Dynamic Task Allocation Model

The common models of UAV swarm task allocation include the multiple traveling salesman problem[7], vehicle routing problem[8], mixed integer linear programming[9], generalized assignment problem[10], dynamic network flow optimization[11], and collaborative task allocation model[12]. As these classical task allocation models need to obtain all task-related information in the initial stage of task allocation, they cannot easily meet the needs of real- time dynamic task allocation in the current uncertain task environment. Therefore, scholars have comprehensively studied dynamic task allocation models and achieved certain results. From the scope of dynamic adjustment, the dynamic task allocation model of UAV swarms oriented to ground targets can be divided into global dynamic allocation models and local dynamic allocation models.

无人机集群任务分配的常见模型包括多旅行商问题 [7] 、车辆路径问题 [8] 、混合整数线性规划 [9] 、广义分配问题 [10] 、动态网络流优化 [11] 以及协同任务分配模型 [12] 。由于这些经典任务分配模型需要在任务分配的初始阶段获取所有任务相关信息，它们难以适应当前不确定任务环境下的实时动态任务分配需求。因此，学者们对动态任务分配模型进行了全面研究，并取得了一定成果。从动态调整的范围来看，面向地面目标的无人机集群动态任务分配模型可分为全局动态分配模型和局部动态分配模型。

#### 2.3.1 Global Dynamic Allocation Models

Global dynamic allocation is similar to the overall hierarchical task allocation before collaborative task execution. The main purpose of this method is to make the task allocation scheme tend to be globally optimal. However, the redistribution of unfinished tasks inevitably leads to a large amount of calculation and a long allocation time, especially when the scale of the problem to be solved is too large, the solution time may be too long, and promptness is difficult to guarantee. Shima et al.[13] proposed the cooperative multiple task assignment problem (CMTAP) for UAVs. In Ref. [14], the CMTAP was improved, and an extended cooperative multitask assignment model was established after considering the difference between UAV mission capabilities and dynamic task time constraints; however, the constraints of the model, such as the volume of ammunition constraints, were not fully considered. In Ref. [15], a dynamic weapon target assignment (WTA) model was proposed with consideration of the multistage cooperative attack problem of two sides in the time dimension on the premise that a weapon's target values for both sides have been obtained; in addition, the dynamic cooperative attack process was simplified into a two-stage static WTA process, which effectively described the complex cooperative attack problem. In Ref. [16], dynamic task allocation was transformed into multistage static task allocation, and a dynamic reconnaissance resource allocation model for multiple UAVs was constructed. The model can improve the overall efficiency of multi-UAV dynamic reconnaissance tasks and meet the needs of dynamic reconnaissance task allocation in large-scale UAV swarm operations. In Ref. [17], a prior information transfer model of multiple UAVs was constructed on the basis of agent modeling language; the model shows the visual modeling method, reduces the decision-making time and communication load of systems, and improves the real-time attack efficiency of the formation. In Ref. [18], a maximum coverage control algorithm for the stochastic orientation problem with a time window was proposed. On the basis of the traveling salesman model, the sudden time sensitive target situation and task execution time were considered to realize time sensitive task allocation.
全局动态分配类似于协作任务执行前的整体层次任务分配。该方法的主要目的是使任务分配方案趋向于全局最优。然而，未完成任务的重分配不可避免地导致大量计算和较长的分配时间，特别是在待解决问题规模过大时，求解时间可能过长，及时性难以保证。Shima 等人 [13] 提出了针对无人机的协作多任务分配问题（CMTAP）。在文献 [14] 中，对 CMTAP 进行了改进，并在考虑了无人机任务能力差异和动态任务时间约束后，建立了一个扩展的协作多任务分配模型；然而，该模型的约束条件，如弹药量约束，并未得到充分考虑。在文献 [15] ，提出了一种考虑时间维度上双方多阶段协同攻击问题的动态武器目标分配（WTA）模型，前提是已获取武器对双方的目标价值；此外，将动态协同攻击过程简化为两阶段静态 WTA 过程，有效描述了复杂的协同攻击问题。在文献 [16] 中，将动态任务分配转化为多阶段静态任务分配，并构建了多无人机动态侦察资源分配模型。该模型能提升多无人机动态侦察任务的整体效率，满足大规模无人机群作战中动态侦察任务分配的需求。在文献 [17] 中，基于代理建模语言构建了多无人机先验信息传递模型；该模型展示了可视化建模方法，减少了系统的决策时间和通信负载，提高了编队的实时攻击效率。在文献 [18] ，提出了一种针对具有时间窗口的随机定向问题的最大覆盖控制算法。在旅行商模型的基础上，考虑了突发时间敏感目标情况和任务执行时间，以实现时间敏感任务分配。

#### 2.3.2 Local Dynamic Allocation Model

To reduce the complexity of a problem to be solved, the method of local dynamic allocation focuses on the characteristics of the task at hand and the UAV, groups the task and UAV accordingly, and then solves the task allocation problem within the task regroup. It then takes the result of the minimum cost increase after the group scheme combination as the group task redistribution scheme. The purpose of this method is to derive a feasible case quickly, but the case obtained may not be optimal. Given the task resource constraints of UAV swarms, cases are grouped according to the principle of “the shortest distance and optimal time”. In Ref. [19], the dynamic task allocation of multiple UAVs with unexpected new tasks was studied, and the state information description model of UAVs executing tasks was constructed. This model groups tasks and UAVs accordingly and reduces the scale of task allocation, time, and communication complexity. In Ref. [20], a multibase and multi-UCAV task allocation model was constructed with consideration of task revenue, task load, and task execution time. When new tasks and platform losses occur, the local adjustment of dynamic tasks can improve the efficiency of task allocation and enhance platform stability. In Ref. [21], which aimed at the cooperative dynamic task allocation problem of multiple UAVs, the optimization indexes of minimizing target strike time and alliance size were taken as the optimization indexes, and the constraints of satisfying simultaneous strike and resource requirements were taken as the constraints. The alliance building model was established, but the influence of communication constraints, such as communication distance and communication time delay, was ignored. Moreover, the coalition formation method requires further improvement. Sampedro et al.[22] proposed a universal global and single-agent dynamic allocation architecture, which supports realtime online task adjustment with global planning and local adjustment strategies. In Ref. [23], a task allocation model for multiple UAVs based on an interval information environment was constructed according to uncertain information, such as the revenue damage cost index, target value, and range cost index. In Ref. [24], a multibase UAV grouping task allocation model was established to solve the problem of dynamic task allocation under different burst conditions; the study pointed out that the UAV grouping task allocation based on a clustering criterion can also be considered in dynamic task allocation. In Ref. [25], the constraints such as communication distance and time delay were fully considered, and a local task allocation model for cases in which heterogeneous clusters found new targets was established; the results showed improved system efficiency.
为降低待解决问题的复杂性，局部动态分配方法着眼于当前任务与无人机的特性，据此对任务与无人机进行分组，进而在任务重组内解决任务分配问题。随后，该方法将组合方案后成本增加最小的结果作为组任务再分配方案。此方法旨在快速得出可行方案，但所得方案未必最优。鉴于无人机群的任务资源限制，方案依据“最短距离与最优时间”原则进行分组。文献 [19] 研究了多无人机在遭遇意外新任务时的动态任务分配，构建了无人机执行任务的状态信息描述模型。该模型相应地对任务与无人机进行分组，减少了任务分配的规模、时间及通信复杂度。文献 [20] 则构建了一个考虑任务收益、任务负载及任务执行时间的多基地多无人作战飞机任务分配模型。 当新任务和平台损失发生时，动态任务的局部调整能够提高任务分配效率并增强平台稳定性。在文献 [21] 中，针对多无人机协同动态任务分配问题，以最小化目标打击时间和联盟规模为优化指标，并以满足同时打击和资源需求为约束条件，建立了联盟构建模型，但忽略了通信距离和通信时延等通信约束的影响。此外，联盟形成方法还需进一步改进。Sampedro 等人 [22] 提出了一种通用的全局和单智能体动态分配架构，该架构支持通过全局规划和局部调整策略进行实时在线任务调整。在文献 [23] 中，根据收益损害成本指数、目标价值和范围成本指数等不确定信息，构建了基于区间信息环境的多无人机任务分配模型。在文献 [24] ，建立了多基地无人机编组任务分配模型，以解决不同突发情况下的动态任务分配问题；研究指出，基于聚类准则的无人机编组任务分配也可考虑用于动态任务分配中。在文献 [25] 中，充分考虑了通信距离和时间延迟等约束条件，建立了异构集群发现新目标时的局部任务分配模型；结果表明系统效率有所提升。

## 3 Solution of Dynamic Task Assignment

The real-time, high dynamic, and NP-hard characteristics of the dynamic task allocation problem bring great challenges to the solution. Therefore, an efficient method should be identified to solve the task allocation problem. In evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of the dynamic task allocation method, the main considerations are solving speed and feasibility. At present, many techniques can be used to solve the problem of UAV swarm dynamic task allocation for ground targets, and the most common ones include the intelligent optimization algorithm, market mechanism-based algorithm, and clustering algorithm[26].
动态任务分配问题的实时性、高动态性和 NP 难特性给解决方案带来了巨大挑战。因此，需要找到一种高效的方法来解决任务分配问题。在评估动态任务分配方法的优缺点时，主要考虑的是求解速度和可行性。目前，许多技术可用于解决无人机群对地面目标的动态任务分配问题，最常见的方法包括智能优化算法、基于市场机制的算法和聚类算法 [26] 。

### 3.1 Algorithm Based on Market Mechanisms

The algorithm based on market mechanisms is one of the most popular methods to solve the problem of dynamic task allocation. In this method, each UAV can be responsible for multiple tasks at the same time, and each UAV in the swarm does not need to know its capabilities in advance and can thus achieve rapid task allocation in a dynamic uncertain environment. However, the UAV swarm adopts an explicit communication mode, which is highly dependent on communication status. When the scale of the UAV swarm is large, system communication obviously affects the efficiency of task allocation. As the distribution result is related to the internal mechanism of the algorithm, the quality of the solution is difficult to guarantee and evaluate. The common methods based on market mechanisms mainly include the auction algorithm[27], [28] and contract net protocol (CNP)[29].
基于市场机制的算法是解决动态任务分配问题最流行的方法之一。在这种方法中，每架无人机可以同时负责多个任务，且群中的每架无人机无需预先了解其能力，从而能在动态不确定环境中实现快速任务分配。然而，无人机群采用显式通信模式，高度依赖通信状态。当无人机群规模较大时，系统通信明显影响任务分配效率。由于分配结果与算法的内部机制相关，解决方案的质量难以保证和评估。基于市场机制的常见方法主要包括拍卖算法 [27], [28] 和合同网协议(CNP) [29] 。

#### 3.1.1 Auction Algorithm

The auction algorithm is an important algorithm for solving the task allocation problem in a dynamic environment[27]. An auction consists of a UAV, mission, revenue function, and cost. The main idea of the algorithm is to imitate the specific auction process and assign a task to a UAV by bidding. The UAV with the highest bidding gets the task. The auction algorithm has the advantages of clear rules and easy operation. As UAV bidding must be delivered to the auctioneer in some way, information delay may occur, and the task allocation results may not be optimal if the operations are not in the same network. Aiming at the shortcomings of the auction algorithm, scholars have made considerable improvements, which have been successfully applied to the task allocation problem of UAVs, robots, and other agents[30]–​[33]. In Ref. [34], which aimed at the real-time allocation of dynamic tasks, a new algorithm for calculating the competitive values of UAVs was proposed; the proposed algorithm can reduce the messages transmitted between UAVs. An agent-based allocation mechanism rooted in the auction process (including a design for three types of agents and the cooperation mechanism among different agents) and a new agent-based real-time task allocation algorithm were proposed to solve the real-time allocation of dynamic tasks. In Ref. [35], the distributed cooperative auction algorithm based on multiple agents was used to study the task reallocation problem, and task reallocation for cases involving new targets was simulated; the results were found to be satisfactory. The reallocation was only performed within a formation. However, no research has explored the reallocation between formations and the reallocation of a single UAV. In addition, the evaluation of tasks and action plans in single-machine task allocation and task allocation with consideration of uncertain factors require further study. Reference [36] improved the distributed auction mechanism and designed the decentralized layered auction algorithm. Each UCAV participating in an attack was called the main layer, and each UCAV carrying a missile was called the sublayer. Before bidding, each UCAV generated the overall bidding sequence. The UCAVs then proceeded to bid. Each missile corresponding to a UCAV was regarded as a separate agent, and a bidding queue was established. Each agent auctioned in turn and constructed all possible target attack schemes. Each agent selected its own “optimal” scheme. A round of bidding was completed until all UCAVs were allocated. In Ref. [37], a sequential auction mechanism based on supervision was proposed to deal with two types of unexpected situations: new UAV and damaged UAV. The auction efficiency function and the process of sequential auction redistribution algorithm were analyzed and designed. The results addressed the defects of the original algorithm, including its failure to realize task migration in the absence of an auctioneer and auction multiple tasks simultaneously.

拍卖算法是解决动态环境下任务分配问题的重要算法 [27] 。拍卖由无人机、任务、收益函数和成本组成。该算法的主要思想是模仿特定的拍卖过程，通过竞价将任务分配给无人机。出价最高的无人机获得任务。拍卖算法具有规则清晰、操作简便的优点。由于无人机竞价必须以某种方式传递给拍卖者，可能会出现信息延迟，如果操作不在同一网络中，任务分配结果可能不是最优的。针对拍卖算法的不足，学者们进行了大量改进，并成功应用于无人机、机器人等智能体的任务分配问题 [30]–​[33] 。在文献 [34] 中，针对动态任务的实时分配，提出了一种新的无人机竞争值计算算法；该算法可以减少无人机之间传输的消息。 为解决动态任务的实时分配问题，提出了一种基于拍卖过程的代理分配机制（包括三种代理的设计及不同代理间的协作机制）和一种新的基于代理的实时任务分配算法。在文献 [35] 中，采用基于多代理的分布式协作拍卖算法研究了任务重分配问题，并对涉及新目标情况下的任务重分配进行了仿真；结果令人满意。然而，重分配仅在编队内部进行。目前尚无研究探讨编队间的重分配及单架无人机的重分配问题。此外，单机任务分配及考虑不确定因素的任务分配中任务与行动计划的评估仍需进一步研究。文献 [36] 改进了分布式拍卖机制，设计了去中心化的分层拍卖算法。参与攻击的每架 UCAV 被称为主层，携带导弹的每架 UCAV 被称为子层。在投标前，每架 UCAV 生成整体投标序列。 随后，UCAVs 开始进行投标。每枚与 UCAV 对应的导弹被视为一个独立的代理，并建立了一个投标队列。每个代理依次进行拍卖，并构建所有可能的目标攻击方案。每个代理选择其“最优”方案。一轮投标完成后，直到所有 UCAV 都被分配完毕。在文献 [37] 中，提出了一种基于监督的顺序拍卖机制，以应对两种意外情况：新无人机和受损无人机。分析并设计了拍卖效率函数和顺序拍卖再分配算法的过程。结果解决了原算法的缺陷，包括在没有拍卖者的情况下无法实现任务迁移以及同时拍卖多个任务的问题。

#### 3.1.2 Contract Net Protocol

The CNP is a negotiation-oriented task allocation method[38], which adopts the mechanism of “tendering–bidding–winning–signing”; it is widely used in studies aiming to solve military problems[39]–​[43]. In the dynamic allocation of UAV swarms, when a UAV cannot deal with a current task or meets a new task, it releases bidding information; other UAVs bid, negotiate, and compete with one another to realize the dynamic allocation and adjustment of tasks. When solving the dynamic task allocation problem, the algorithm exhibits good fault tolerance and strong expansibility, and it can quickly adjust the allocation scheme. However, given the limited grasp of battlefield information of decision-makers, the quality of solutions is difficult to guarantee. In Ref. [44], a new optimal task allocation method with improved CNP was proposed on the basis of the multiagent system (MAS) and CNP; the proposed method realizes dynamic task allocation according to environment changes and improves the cooperation ability and efficiency between UAVs. Reference [45] proposed a multi-UCAV distributed task allocation method on the basis of an extended contract network. Considering that the traditional contract network easily falls into local optimization, the study extended the types of contract networks. Four contract types were comprehensively adopted: sales contract, exchange contract, replacement contract, and cluster contract. In view of the low negotiation efficiency of the traditional contract network, the transaction mechanism of contract networks was extended to support multiple transactions in one auction. This method reduces the communication time of UCAVs in the negotiation process, improves the negotiation efficiency of contract networks, and provides ideas for dynamic solutions. In Ref. [46], which aimed to address the low efficiency of the task assignment algorithm of traditional contract networks in a dynamic environment, the task allocation method in a traditional contract network was improved by introducing the indicators of task trust and load balance, which can increase system revenue and reduce the time required to complete tasks in an MAS. However, the study assumed that the decomposed task could be completed by a single agent independently. In an actual system, some cases cannot be completed by a single agent alone, and the actual task situation can be increasingly complex. In Ref. [47], the problem of cooperative search and simultaneous attack of reconnaissance/attack UAV groups against multiple targets was studied. With consideration of the track cost and UAV resource constraints, a task allocation algorithm for maximum system efficiency in a real-time environment was proposed on the basis of the CNP. A contract net algorithm based on concurrency was proposed in Ref. [48]. The algorithm auctions multiple tasks simultaneously and selects high-quality bidders. This algorithm deals with all types of emergencies in task execution quickly and effectively, improves negotiation efficiency, reduces communication loads, and effectively meets the needs of dynamic task allocation. In Ref. [49], which considered static and dynamic obstacles, the contract net algorithm was used to reallocate a task after a UAV crash; the proposed algorithm can efficiently complete the task reallocation of multiple heterogeneous UAVs with minimum total cost. In Ref. [50], which aimed at the problems of low resource utilization and low efficiency of task allocation in traditional contract net algorithms, a task allocation method for multiple UAVs based on an improved contract net algorithm was proposed. The method adds time and cooperation conditions to the task information in the contract and sends the task to the UAV in the form of broadcast. UAVs bid with time, cooperation, and flight distance as constraints. The task manager selects the optimal allocation method by collecting and comparing the bids of UAVs so as to realize the task allocation for multi-UAV cooperation. This method solves the problem of unreasonable task allocation and improves the efficiency of task allocation and execution.
CNP 是一种面向协商的任务分配方法 [38] ，采用“招标-投标-中标-签约”机制；它广泛应用于旨在解决军事问题的研究中 [39]–​[43] 。在无人机群的动态分配中，当无人机无法处理当前任务或遇到新任务时，它会发布投标信息；其他无人机进行投标、协商和竞争，以实现任务的动态分配和调整。在解决动态任务分配问题时，该算法表现出良好的容错性和强大的扩展性，并能快速调整分配方案。然而，鉴于决策者对战场信息的掌握有限，解决方案的质量难以保证。在文献 [44] 中，基于多智能体系统（MAS）和 CNP，提出了一种改进 CNP 的新型最优任务分配方法；该方法根据环境变化实现动态任务分配，并提高了无人机之间的协作能力和效率。文献 [45] 提出了一种基于扩展合同网络的多 UCAV 分布式任务分配方法。 鉴于传统合同网络易陷入局部优化，研究扩展了合同网络的类型，全面采用了四种合同类型：销售合同、交换合同、替换合同和集群合同。针对传统合同网络协商效率低下的问题，扩展了合同网络的交易机制，以支持在一次拍卖中进行多笔交易。该方法减少了 UCAV 在协商过程中的通信时间，提高了合同网络的协商效率，并为动态解决方案提供了思路。在文献 [46] 中，旨在解决传统合同网络任务分配算法在动态环境中效率低下的问题，通过引入任务信任和负载均衡指标改进了传统合同网络中的任务分配方法，这能够增加系统收益并减少 MAS 中完成任务所需的时间。然而，该研究假设分解后的任务可由单个代理独立完成。 在实际系统中，某些任务无法由单一代理单独完成，且实际任务情境可能日益复杂。文献 [47] 研究了侦察/攻击无人机群对多目标的协同搜索与同时攻击问题。考虑到航迹成本与无人机资源限制，基于合同网协议（CNP），提出了一种实时环境下最大化系统效率的任务分配算法。文献 [48] 提出了一种基于并发的合同网算法，该算法同时拍卖多个任务并选择高质量投标者，能快速有效地处理任务执行中的各类突发事件，提高协商效率，减少通信负载，有效满足动态任务分配的需求。文献 [49] 在考虑静态与动态障碍物的情况下，利用合同网算法在无人机坠毁后重新分配任务；所提算法能够以最小总成本高效完成多异构无人机的任务重分配。 针对传统合同网算法中资源利用率低和任务分配效率低的问题，提出了一种基于改进合同网算法的多无人机任务分配方法。该方法在合同中的任务信息中增加了时间和协作条件，并以广播形式将任务发送给无人机。无人机以时间、协作和飞行距离为约束进行投标。任务管理器通过收集和比较无人机的投标来选择最优分配方式，从而实现多无人机协作的任务分配。该方法解决了任务分配不合理的问题，提高了任务分配和执行的效率。

### 3.2 Intelligent Optimization Algorithm

The intelligent optimization algorithm is a type of random search method inspired by natural phenomena or social behavior[51], [52]. This algorithm has strong generality, good robustness, and fast solving speed. Therefore, it is widely used to solve the dynamic task allocation of UAV swarms. In particular, evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence algorithms are applicable to large-scale and nonlinear problems.
智能优化算法是一种受自然现象或社会行为启发的随机搜索方法 [51], [52] 。该算法具有通用性强、鲁棒性好、求解速度快等特点，因此被广泛应用于无人机群动态任务分配的求解中。特别是进化计算和群体智能算法，适用于大规模和非线性问题。

#### 3.2.1 Evolutionary Computation

Evolutionary computation is aimed at searching for optimal solutions by simulating the biological evolution process proposed by Darwin. In the task allocation stage, different behaviors are used to perform the dynamic allocation of different tasks on the basis of evolutionary computation so as to optimize the overall allocation. The representative algorithm of evolutionary computation is the genetic algorithm (GA), which is widely used in UAV task allocation[53], [54]. However, as the number of iterations required to produce the chromosomes satisfying specific conditions increases, the optimization time increases exponentially with the increase of the scale; hence, achieving large-scale dynamic task allocation is difficult. In Ref. [55], multiobjective optimization and evolutionary computation were combined to achieve time-sensitive target assignment. However, in the process of multiple operations, the search space was not fully explored, thereby leading to the premature convergence of the evolutionary process and the failure to find the best solution. In Ref. [56], a dynamic programming model for a single task type with a small feasible solution scale was studied on the basis of the GA. Through preassignment, target redistribution was performed when the strike was unsuccessful or when new targets appeared. However, the algorithm is limited to the same numbers of UAVs and targets, and it is not suitable for complex assignment problems. In Ref. [57], under the background of the heterogeneous multi-UAV cooperative execution of the suppression of energy air defenses, a distributed GA was used to solve the problem of multi-UAV agent cooperative task allocation. The core of the proposed algorithm is the parallel processing of the basic GA. Multiple basic GAs are dispersed to each UAV. Its fitness function and selection process are consistent with the basic GA. The proposed algorithm shows good applicability in complex task scenarios and is easily understood. In Ref. [58], a GA based on matrix coding was proposed to solve the timing problem of task allocation; the proposed method has good task allocation efficiency, but the time interval between tasks was not considered in the model.
进化计算旨在通过模拟达尔文提出的生物进化过程来搜索最优解。在任务分配阶段，基于进化计算采用不同行为执行不同任务的动态分配，以优化整体分配。进化计算的代表性算法是遗传算法（GA），该算法在无人机任务分配中得到了广泛应用 [53], [54] 。然而，随着满足特定条件的染色体所需迭代次数的增加，优化时间随规模增大呈指数增长；因此，实现大规模动态任务分配较为困难。在文献 [55] 中，多目标优化与进化计算相结合，实现了时间敏感的目标分配。然而，在多次操作过程中，搜索空间未能充分探索，导致进化过程过早收敛，未能找到最佳解。在文献 [56] 中，基于遗传算法（GA）研究了一种适用于单一任务类型且可行解规模较小的动态规划模型。通过预分配，在打击失败或出现新目标时进行目标重新分配。然而，该算法仅限于无人机与目标数量相同的情况，不适用于复杂的分配问题。在 [57] 中，以异构多无人机协同执行压制能源防空任务为背景，采用分布式遗传算法解决了多无人机代理协同任务分配问题。该算法的核心在于对基本遗传算法的并行处理，多个基本遗传算法被分散到每架无人机上，其适应度函数和选择过程与基本遗传算法一致。所提出的算法在复杂任务场景中表现出良好的适用性，且易于理解。在 [58] 中，提出了一种基于矩阵编码的遗传算法来解决任务分配的时间安排问题；该方法具有良好的任务分配效率，但模型中未考虑任务间的时间间隔。

#### 3.2.2 Swarm Intelligence Algorithm

Inspired by the behavior of biological groups in nature, the swarm intelligence algorithm refers to the formation of multiple individuals representing candidate solutions that form a group and achieve the purpose of optimization through information interaction between part of all. The use of iterative optimization based on the swarm intelligence algorithm to determine the best scheme of dynamic task allocation takes a long time and involves a single task type. Hence, the algorithm is usually used in the distribution process with little change in environmental information. The commonly used swarm intelligence algorithms mainly include ant colony optimization[59] and particle swarm optimization (PSO)[60]. Reference [61] proposed a real-time dynamic algorithm on the basis of chaotic PSO by adding chaos initialization and anytime response capability to the basic PSO algorithm to solve the dynamic target allocation problem in the process of a missile cooperative attack. The algorithm exhibits real-time dynamic characteristics, including the capability of handling unexpected targets and responding to the current battlefield state at any time. However, the convergence speed of the algorithm is slow, the complexity and fuzziness of the battlefield environment are high, and the real-time requirements are difficult to realize; hence, the algorithm often performs poorly. In Ref. [62], the dynamic task allocation problem in swarm air combat was decomposed into a game problem between single UAVs by using dynamic game theory, and the predator–prey PSO algorithm was proposed to solve the problem. However, this method is only suitable for small-scale swarm operations, and it cannot easily deal with the problem of large-scale swarm confrontation. Combining the advantages and disadvantages of PSO and the bacterial foraging algorithm, a hybrid bacterial foraging algorithm was proposed in Ref. [63] to solve the dynamic task allocation problem of multiple UCAVs. To ensure the quality of the solution and meet real-time requirements, Ref. [64] explored a real-time task allocation method based on a centralized algorithm, used PSO to solve specific task allocation problems, designed a particle 0-1 coding method and a correction method for nonstandard particles, and achieved good results. However, the study only considered the case in which the target is static and thus suffers some limitations. Reference [65] proposed a hybrid genetic ant colony algorithm on the basis of the rapid iteration of the GA, the positive feedback information of the ant colony algorithm, and the distributed solution; then, the dynamic task allocation of the agent was optimized. The algorithm has the advantages of fast search speed, strong global optimization ability, effectiveness in dynamic task allocation, and good performance in terms of timeliness and accuracy.
受自然界生物群体行为的启发，群体智能算法指的是由代表候选解的多个个体形成群体，并通过部分或全部个体间的信息交互实现优化目的。基于群体智能算法进行迭代优化以确定动态任务分配的最佳方案耗时较长且任务类型单一，因此该算法通常用于环境信息变化较小的分配过程。常用的群体智能算法主要包括蚁群优化 [59] 和粒子群优化(PSO) [60] 。参考文献 [61] 在混沌 PSO 的基础上，通过向基本 PSO 算法添加混沌初始化和随时响应能力，提出了一种实时动态算法，用于解决导弹协同攻击过程中的动态目标分配问题。该算法展现出实时动态特性，包括处理意外目标和随时响应当前战场状态的能力。 然而，该算法的收敛速度较慢，战场环境的复杂性和模糊性较高，实时性要求难以实现；因此，该算法往往表现不佳。在文献 [62] 中，通过运用动态博弈理论将群体空战中的动态任务分配问题分解为单无人机间的博弈问题，并提出了捕食者-猎物粒子群优化算法来解决此问题。然而，该方法仅适用于小规模群体作战，难以应对大规模群体对抗问题。结合粒子群优化算法与细菌觅食算法的优缺点，文献 [63] 提出了一种混合细菌觅食算法，用于解决多无人作战飞行器的动态任务分配问题。为确保解的质量并满足实时性要求，文献 [64] 探索了一种基于集中式算法的实时任务分配方法，采用粒子群优化算法解决具体任务分配问题，设计了粒子 0-1 编码方法及非标准粒子的校正方法，取得了良好效果。 然而，该研究仅考虑了目标静止的情况，因此存在一些局限性。参考文献 [65] 提出了一种基于遗传算法快速迭代、蚁群算法正反馈信息及分布式求解的混合遗传蚁群算法，进而优化了代理的动态任务分配。该算法具有搜索速度快、全局优化能力强、动态任务分配有效以及在时效性和准确性方面表现良好的优势。

### 3.3 Clustering Algorithm

The clustering algorithm is a target task classification method that takes a task as a cluster to cluster, reveals the correlation and difference between tasks, and achieves task allocation by meeting the consistency of the number of task clusters and UAVs. Distance clustering is usually used in UAV task allocation. The k-means algorithm[66] and its related improved algorithm are commonly used in clustering algorithms, and they have been widely adopted in UAV assignments. The clustering algorithm is fast, but it is only suitable for scenes with similar tasks. Hence, it is difficult to extend to general situations. Shi et al.[67] proposed a multi-UAV dynamic task allocation method on the basis of iterative self-organizing data analysis constraint clustering. By setting threshold parameters and dynamically merging or splitting classes, the method can adaptively calculate the set K value and finally obtain a task scheme that meets dynamic requirements, which can promote the dynamic task allocation of UAV swarms. In Ref. [68], an improved k-means clustering algorithm was proposed for the k-initial value problem and was used to cluster and group the “UAV task” set; then, the task reassignment of multiple UAVs was performed by separating and combining the PSO algorithm within the group. This dynamic task allocation strategy based on grouping can obtain high revenues with a minimal time cost, but it is difficult to be used to obtain optimal solutions at the expense of overall interests.
聚类算法是一种将任务作为聚类对象的目标任务分类方法，通过揭示任务间的关联与差异，并确保任务簇数量与无人机数量的一致性来实现任务分配。在无人机任务分配中，通常采用距离聚类方法。k-means 算法 [66] 及其相关改进算法是聚类算法中的常用方法，并已在无人机任务分配中得到广泛应用。聚类算法虽快速，但仅适用于任务相似的场景，因此难以推广至一般情况。Shi 等人 [67] 基于迭代自组织数据分析约束聚类提出了一种多无人机动态任务分配方法。该方法通过设定阈值参数并动态合并或分裂类簇，能够自适应计算集合 K 值，最终获得满足动态需求的任务方案，从而促进无人机群的动态任务分配。参考文献中， [68] ，针对 k 初始值问题提出了一种改进的 k-means 聚类算法，并用于“无人机任务”集的聚类分组；随后，通过在组内分离与结合 PSO 算法，实现了多无人机的任务重分配。这种基于分组的动态任务分配策略能以最小时间成本获得高收益，但难以在牺牲整体利益的情况下获得最优解。

### 3.4 Other Algorithms

In addition to the aforementioned algorithms, other algorithms have been applied to solve the dynamic allocation of UAV swarms. Reference [69] proposed a time-sensitive task dynamic allocation algorithm. According to the time window change of time-sensitive targets and the performance differences of UAVs, the algorithm realizes the dynamic allocation of time-sensitive targets and improves the overall effectiveness of the UAV formation attacking multiple time-sensitive targets in a battlefield environment; however, it does not consider the adverse effects of communication delays in the cooperative process. Reference [70] proposed a feasible robust algorithm, which extracts UAV mission-related state parameters into multidimensional eigenvectors, constructs the state parameter matrices of all UAVs within the control unit, calculates the cosine value of the eigenvector direction, and uses the right singular value matrix after the matrix decomposition to sort emergency tasks under dynamic conditions and thereby realize the priority allocation of urgent tasks. The algorithm is simple, time-consuming, and capable of meeting the requirements of reliability and rapidity of combat problem solving; however, the classification results are slightly rough. In Ref. [71], a human intervention dynamic task allocation mechanism was proposed; in this mechanism, the dynamic task allocation of UAV swarms is realized by the manual adjustment of the commander. However, this method is time-consuming, and it cannot ensure the stability and reliability of man–machine communication. In Ref. [72], which aimed at the dynamic nature of new tasks in a task space, three dynamic allocation strategies were proposed on the basis of the consensus-based coalition algorithm (CBCA) for new tasks in a task space. The FR-CBCA strategy has the best result with the longest time, the NR-CBCA strategy has the best real-time performance but the lowest dynamic allocation revenue value, and the PR-CBCA strategy has high-quality planning results and timely response to unexpected new tasks. Tamura et al.[73] proposed a dynamic task allocation method on the basis of multiround negotiation and body expansion behavior. This method improves the efficiency of task execution and reduces the computing time and communication load. In Ref. [74], a variable structure discrete dynamic Bayesian network reasoning algorithm was proposed to study the task assignment problem of UAVs in an uncertain environment. Reference [75] obtained the acceptability level index, central weight vector, and self-confidence factor of different targets to be allocated through random multiattribute acceptability analysis, which provides a reliable basis for target allocation. This method takes full account of the uncertainty of information, the calculation method is simple, and the analysis results are intuitive and concise. In Ref. [76], reinforcement learning was applied to the task allocation of UAVs, and a networking scheme based on an expansion strategy was designed. On the basis of this scheme, UAVs can improve allocation through autonomous learning. In the study, experiments were conducted on UAV swarms to obtain satisfactory optimization results.
除了上述算法外，其他算法也被应用于解决无人机群的动态分配问题。参考文献 [69] 提出了一种时间敏感任务动态分配算法。该算法根据时间敏感目标的时间窗口变化和无人机性能差异，实现了时间敏感目标的动态分配，并提高了无人机编队在战场环境中攻击多个时间敏感目标的整体效能；然而，它并未考虑协作过程中通信延迟的不利影响。参考文献 [70] 提出了一种可行的鲁棒算法，该算法将无人机任务相关的状态参数提取为多维特征向量，构建控制单元内所有无人机的状态参数矩阵，计算特征向量方向的余弦值，并利用矩阵分解后的右奇异值矩阵对动态条件下的紧急任务进行排序，从而实现紧急任务的优先分配。 该算法简单、耗时，能够满足作战问题求解的可靠性和快速性要求；然而，分类结果略显粗糙。在文献 [71] 中，提出了一种人工干预的动态任务分配机制；在该机制中，无人机群的动态任务分配通过指挥员的手动调整实现。然而，这种方法耗时，且无法确保人机通信的稳定性和可靠性。在文献 [72] 中，针对任务空间中新任务的动态特性，基于共识联盟算法（CBCA）提出了三种动态分配策略。FR-CBCA 策略效果最佳但耗时最长，NR-CBCA 策略实时性最佳但动态分配收益值最低，PR-CBCA 策略规划质量高且能及时响应意外新任务。Tamura 等人 [73] 提出了一种基于多轮协商和群体扩展行为的动态任务分配方法。 该方法提高了任务执行的效率，减少了计算时间和通信负载。在文献 [74] 中，提出了一种可变结构离散动态贝叶斯网络推理算法，用于研究无人机在不确定环境下的任务分配问题。文献 [75] 通过随机多属性可接受性分析，获得了不同待分配目标的可接受性水平指标、中心权重向量和自信因子，为目标分配提供了可靠依据。该方法充分考虑了信息的不确定性，计算方法简单，分析结果直观简洁。在文献 [76] 中，将强化学习应用于无人机的任务分配，并设计了一种基于扩展策略的组网方案。基于该方案，无人机能够通过自主学习改进分配。研究中，对无人机群进行了实验，获得了令人满意的优化结果。

In sum, the dynamic task allocation of UAV swarms for ground targets involves UAV swarms that are in the process of executing early assigned tasks. In cases of emergencies, such as UAV failure and mission cancellation, the task planning results need to be dynamically adjusted to adapt to the changes in the environment. Thus, the dynamic task allocation algorithm requires high real-time performance. Combined with the relevant research at home and abroad, this work finds that the current solution algorithms mostly adopt methods based on market mechanisms, intelligent optimization algorithms, and clustering algorithms. These methods have strong dynamics, fast solution speed, and the capability of meeting the needs of dynamic task allocation. For specific allocation problems, scholars have made significant improvements to enhance existing algorithms' convergence speed, timeliness of allocation, and allocation efficiency. Nevertheless, the scale and precision of solutions still have room for improvement. Table 1 shows the comparison results of common dynamic task allocation algorithms.
总之，针对地面目标的无人机群动态任务分配涉及正在执行早期分配任务的无人机群。在紧急情况下，如无人机故障和任务取消，需要动态调整任务规划结果以适应环境变化。因此，动态任务分配算法要求具有较高的实时性。结合国内外相关研究，本工作发现当前的解决方案算法大多采用基于市场机制、智能优化算法和聚类算法的方法。这些方法具有强大的动态性、快速的求解速度，并能满足动态任务分配的需求。针对具体的分配问题，学者们已对现有算法进行了显著改进，以提高其收敛速度、分配的及时性和分配效率。然而，解决方案的规模和精度仍有提升空间。 Table 1 展示了常见动态任务分配算法的比较结果。

## 4 Future Research Prospects

### 4.1 Existing Problems

Although a large number of studies on the dynamic task allocation method of UAV swarms oriented to ground targets have contributed to the establishment and solution of problem models, several problems remain.
尽管大量关于面向地面目标的无人机群动态任务分配方法的研究促进了问题模型的建立与求解，但仍存在若干问题。

First, the constraints are oversimplified. Most existing research regards the UAV dynamic task allocation model as too ideal and easy to solve, and the results greatly deviate from actual tasks. Hence, existing methods cannot meet actual requirements. This problem is mainly manifested in the following aspects: First, the existing UAV swarm task allocation model assumes that the space is two-dimensional and that the target is static. Such assumption is a simplification of actual application scenarios and thus leads to the low fault tolerance and poor adaptability of the model. Second, most current research does not start from the perspective of task allocation complexity and only establishes general task models for task allocation problems of different scales. This approach results in low efficiency and poor real-time performance when these models solve large-scale task allocation problems. Third, the flight performance, flight distance, flight speed, UAV damage degree, and other attributes of UAVs in UAV swarms are not fully considered, thus leading to the poor coordination of UAV swarms in the mission phase.
首先，约束条件过于简化。现有研究大多将无人机动态任务分配模型视为过于理想且易于求解，导致结果与实际任务存在较大偏差。因此，现有方法无法满足实际需求。这一问题主要体现在以下几个方面：第一，现有无人机集群任务分配模型假设空间为二维且目标静止。这种假设是对实际应用场景的简化，导致模型的容错性低、适应性差。第二，当前大多数研究并未从任务分配复杂性的角度出发，仅为不同规模的任务分配问题建立通用任务模型。这种方法在解决大规模任务分配问题时效率低下且实时性差。第三，未充分考虑无人机集群中无人机的飞行性能、飞行距离、飞行速度、无人机损伤程度等属性，导致无人机集群在任务阶段的协调性差。

Second, the construction of the swarm structure is too simple. The dynamic task allocation problem is a multiformation task allocation problem in complex and uncertain environments. At present, most UAV swarm systems have a small number and a single type of aircraft. The design of the architecture and the task allocation method do not greatly consider the reconfigurability between UAVs in the system. With the uncertainty of the modern battlefield environment, the scale of UAV swarms expands, and the autonomous decision-making ability of UAV formation is slightly insufficient.
其次，集群结构的构建过于简单。动态任务分配问题是在复杂且不确定环境中的多编队任务分配问题。目前，大多数无人机集群系统飞机数量少、类型单一，架构设计和任务分配方法并未充分考虑系统中无人机之间的可重构性。随着现代战场环境的不确定性增加，无人机集群规模扩大，无人机编队的自主决策能力略显不足。

Finally, solution algorithms cannot easily meet real-time allocation requirements. In dynamic task allocation, the analysis and judgment of UAV damage, new targets, task updates, and other emergencies should be completed within the limited operation time, and scientific decision-making should be made to obtain a satisfactory solution. For the dynamic adjustment of large-scale UAV swarms, the solution space increases, the allocation solution set increases exponentially, and the effectiveness of the algorithms decreases significantly. Hence, real-time and accurate allocation is difficult to achieve.
最后，求解算法难以满足实时分配需求。在动态任务分配中，对无人机损毁、新目标出现、任务更新等突发情况的分析判断需在有限的操作时间内完成，并做出科学决策以获得满意的解决方案。对于大规模无人机群的动态调整，解空间增大，分配解集呈指数级增长，算法有效性显著下降，因此难以实现实时准确的分配。

### 4.2.1 Enhance the Practicability of the Model

First, the performance of dynamic task allocation algorithms is closely related to their models. Only by establishing a problem model that matches the algorithm can the performance of the algorithm be fully displayed. Second, constraints should be comprehensively considered, and a realistic model must be established to enhance the feasibility of allocation results. Therefore, in future research, the task allocation model should be continuously optimized to match actual conditions.
首先，动态任务分配算法的性能与其模型密切相关。只有建立与算法相匹配的问题模型，才能充分展现算法的性能。其次，应全面考虑约束条件，建立符合实际的模型，以增强分配结果的可行性。因此，在未来的研究中，应不断优化任务分配模型，使其与实际条件相匹配。

#### 4.2.2 Improve the Performance of the Algorithm

The expansion of the UAV swarm scale, the diversification of tasks, and the high dynamic environment inevitably lead to the growth of the task allocation solution set. However, current algorithms still suffer from limitations. Hence, future research should seek to improve the performance of these algorithms and equip UAV swarm systems with the capabilities of autonomous computing and independent decision-making so that they are able to meet task requirements.
无人机群规模的扩大、任务的多样化以及高动态环境不可避免地导致任务分配解决方案集的增长。然而，现有算法仍存在局限性。因此，未来的研究应致力于提升这些算法的性能，并赋予无人机群系统自主计算与独立决策的能力，以满足任务需求。

#### 4.2.3 Explore a Completely Dynamic Task Allocation Strategy

The current dynamic task allocation is mainly based on the idea of obtaining a portion of the target information in advance. During emergencies, the task preallocation scheme can be adjusted quickly. However, obtaining information in advance is difficult. Hence, a fully dynamic task allocation strategy should be explored in future research.
当前动态任务分配主要基于预先获取部分目标信息的思路。在紧急情况下，任务预分配方案可以快速调整。然而，预先获取信息较为困难。因此，未来的研究应探索一种完全动态的任务分配策略。
